The CSS rule `background-image: url(image.jpg);` fails to load the image if the path to `image.jpg` is incorrect or the image file doesn't exist.  Another less obvious issue can be caused by caching; if the image has been updated on the server, browsers may continue to use the cached version.  Forcing a cache refresh by adding a query parameter to the URL (e.g., `background-image: url(image.jpg?v=1);` and incrementing the version number each time the image is updated) can solve this. Incorrect MIME type of the image file on the server can also cause issues.
